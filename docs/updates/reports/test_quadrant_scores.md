# Quadrant Score Display Fix Test

## Issue Fixed
The quadrant cards were displaying inconsistent score formats like:
- Behavior: "87.6/40" (obtained score higher than max)
- Persona: "75.4/30" 
- Discipline: "79.5/10" (obtained higher than max)
- Wellness: "83.5/20"

## Root Cause
The QuadrantCard component was displaying `{quadrant.obtained}/{quadrant.weightage}` instead of `{quadrant.obtained}/{quadrant.maxScore}`.

The `weightage` field represents the percentage weightage of the quadrant (e.g., 40%, 30%, 10%, 20%), not the maximum possible score.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated QuadrantData Interface
- Added `maxScore: number` field to properly represent maximum possible score

### 2. Fixed QuadrantCard Component
- Changed display from `{quadrant.obtained}/{quadrant.weightage}` to `{quadrant.obtained}/{quadrant.maxScore}`
- Updated percentage calculation to use `quadrant.maxScore` instead of `quadrant.weightage`
- Fixed batch average and batch best displays

### 3. Updated Backend API Response
- Modified `getStudentPerformance` to include `maxScore` field in quadrant data
- Fixed HPS score conversion from percentage to actual points
- Ensured consistent score format across all quadrant calculations

### 4. Fixed Data Transformation
- Updated `dataTransform.ts` to properly map `maxScore` from API response
- Added fallback logic for backward compatibility

### 5. Updated All Score Display Locations
- Fixed QuadrantDetail.tsx score display
- Fixed StudentDashboard.tsx badge displays
- Updated mock data to include maxScore values

## Expected Result
Quadrant cards should now display accurate scores like:
- Behavior: "35.0/40" (87.5% of 40 points)
- Persona: "37.7/50" (75.4% of 50 points)  
- Discipline: "7.9/10" (79.5% of 10 points)
- Wellness: "16.7/20" (83.5% of 20 points)

## Test Steps
1. Login as sripathi@e.com
2. Navigate to Student Dashboard
3. Check quadrant cards display proper "obtained/maxScore" format
4. Navigate to different intervention details pages
5. Verify scores are consistent and mathematically correct
