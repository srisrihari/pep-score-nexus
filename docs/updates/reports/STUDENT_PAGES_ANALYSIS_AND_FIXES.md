# Student Pages Analysis & Fixes - Comprehensive Report

## Executive Summary

Successfully identified and resolved all data inconsistencies and broken UI/UX flows for student "Sripathi" (email: sripathi@e.com) in the PEP Score Nexus application. The root causes were missing enrollment records and data relationship gaps, which have been completely fixed.

## Issues Identified & Root Causes

### 1. **Data Inconsistencies**

  - Student term enrollment for current term
  - Proper current term assignment

### 2. **Broken UI/UX Flows**
- **Problem**: Navigation between student pages showed conflicting information
- **Root Cause**: Frontend APIs were failing due to missing enrollment data
- **Impact**: Inconsistent score displays across different views

### 3. **Improvement Page Issues**
- **Problem**: Contained generic information unrelated to actual student performance
- **Root Cause**: Improvement plan API was working but needed actual data to generate relevant recommendations
