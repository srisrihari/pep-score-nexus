# üîç **COMPREHENSIVE TERM SYSTEM AUDIT REPORT**

## **üìä EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

After conducting a thorough audit of the PEP Score Nexus application, I've identified **CRITICAL GAPS** in the term system implementation. While the database schema supports terms properly, there are significant missing pieces in both backend and frontend that prevent proper term-based functionality.

---

## **üóÑÔ∏è DATABASE ANALYSIS**

### **‚úÖ STRENGTHS**
1. **Proper Schema Design**: 
   - `terms` table exists with proper structure
   - `student_terms` table for term-specific student data
   - All score-related tables have `term_id` foreign keys
   - Interventions have `term_id` support

2. **Current Data State**:
   - 1 term exists: "Term 1 / Level 0" (2024-01-01 to 2024-06-30)
   - 6 scores exist, all linked to the current term
   - 0 student_terms records (CRITICAL ISSUE)

### **‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUES**
1. **No Student-Term Enrollment**: `student_terms` table is empty
2. **No Term Management**: No API endpoints for term CRUD operations
3. **Hardcoded Term References**: Students have `current_term = 'Term1'` (string) instead of proper term_id references

---

## **üîß BACKEND ANALYSIS**

### **‚úÖ PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION**
1. **Term-Aware Queries**: Most controllers fetch current term using `is_current = true`
2. **Term Parameter Support**: Many endpoints accept `termId` query parameter
3. **Term-Based Filtering**: Scores, attendance, and performance queries are term-aware

### **‚ùå MISSING CRITICAL COMPONENTS**

#### **1. No Term Management APIs**
```bash
# MISSING ENDPOINTS:
GET    /api/v1/terms                    # List all terms
POST   /api/v1/terms                    # Create new term
PUT    /api/v1/terms/:id                # Update term
DELETE /api/v1/terms/:id                # Delete term
POST   /api/v1/terms/:id/activate       # Set as current term
POST   /api/v1/terms/transition         # Transition students to new term
```

#### **2. No Term Transition Logic**
- No automatic score initialization for new terms
- No student enrollment in new terms
- No term rollover functionality

#### **3. Inconsistent Term Handling**
- Students table uses string `current_term` instead of `term_id` FK
- No validation for term dates
- No term-based access control

---

## **üé® FRONTEND ANALYSIS**

### **‚úÖ PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION**
1. **Term Selectors**: Student and teacher dashboards have term dropdowns
2. **Term-Aware Components**: QuadrantDetail, StudentDashboard show term selection
3. **Term State Management**: Local state for selected terms

### **‚ùå MISSING CRITICAL COMPONENTS**

#### **1. No Global Term Context**
```typescript
// MISSING: Global term management
const TermContext = createContext({
  currentTerm: null,
  availableTerms: [],
  setCurrentTerm: () => {},
  isTermTransitioning: false
});
```

#### **2. No Sidebar Term Selector**
- No global term selector in sidebar
- Term selection is component-specific
- No app-wide term state synchronization

#### **3. No Term Management UI**
- No admin interface for term management
- No term creation/editing forms
- No term transition workflows

---

## **üö® CRITICAL MISSING FEATURES**

### **1. Term Transition System**
```sql
-- MISSING: Automatic term transition
-- When new term starts:
-- 1. Create student_terms records for all active students
-- 2. Initialize scores as 0/N/A for all components
-- 3. Reset attendance records
-- 4. Update student current_term
```

### **2. Term-Based Data Isolation**
- Interventions don't properly filter by term
- Tasks don't inherit term from intervention start date
- No term-based reporting

### **3. Academic Year Management**
- No 4-terms-per-year structure
- No automatic term progression
- No term scheduling

---

## **üìã DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION GAPS**

### **Backend Missing APIs**
1. **Term Management Controller** (`termController.js`) - MISSING
2. **Term Routes** (`/api/v1/terms`) - MISSING
3. **Term Transition Service** - MISSING
4. **Term Validation Middleware** - MISSING

### **Frontend Missing Components**
1. **Global Term Context** (`TermContext.tsx`) - MISSING
2. **Sidebar Term Selector** - MISSING
3. **Term Management Pages** - MISSING
4. **Term Transition UI** - MISSING

### **Database Issues**
1. **Empty student_terms table** - CRITICAL
2. **Inconsistent term references** - CRITICAL
3. **No term-based constraints** - MODERATE

---

## **üéØ RECOMMENDED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

2. Implement global term context
3. Add sidebar term selector
4. Fix student-term enrollment

### **Phase 2: Term Transition (Week 1)**

## **üîß IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS**

### **1. Database Fixes**
```sql
-- Fix student-term enrollment
INSERT INTO student_terms (student_id, term_id, enrollment_status, total_score, grade)
SELECT id, '733c5378-7278-4a4d-a2c8-14855370b33f', 'Enrolled', 0.00, 'IC'
FROM students WHERE status = 'Active';

-- Update student current_term to use term_id
ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN current_term_id UUID REFERENCES terms(id);
UPDATE students SET current_term_id = '733c5378-7278-4a4d-a2c8-14855370b33f';
```

### **2. Backend Implementation**
- Create `backend/src/controllers/termController.js`
- Create `backend/src/routes/terms.js`
- Add term management endpoints
- Implement term transition logic

### **3. Frontend Implementation**
- Create `frontend/src/contexts/TermContext.tsx`
- Add global term selector to sidebar
- Create term management pages
- Implement term switching logic

## **üìä IMPACT ASSESSMENT**

### **Current State: 30% Complete**
- ‚úÖ Database schema (90% complete)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Backend APIs (40% complete)
- ‚ùå Frontend UI (20% complete)
- ‚ùå Term transitions (0% complete)

### **Business Impact**
- **HIGH**: Cannot properly track student progress across terms
- **HIGH**: No academic year management
- **MEDIUM**: Limited reporting capabilities
- **MEDIUM**: Poor user experience with term switching

### **Technical Debt**
- **HIGH**: Inconsistent term handling
- **HIGH**: Missing critical APIs
- **MEDIUM**: No global state management
- **LOW**: UI/UX improvements needed

## **‚úÖ CONCLUSION**

The term system in PEP Score Nexus requires **significant implementation work** to meet the academic requirements. While the foundation exists, critical components for term management, transition, and user experience are missing. Immediate action is needed to implement proper term functionality.

**Priority**: üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Term system is fundamental to academic management and must be implemented immediately.
