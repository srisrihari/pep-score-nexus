   - Test single batch, section, course, house filters
   - Test status filtering

2. **Advanced Multi-Select Filtering**
   - Test `batch_ids` parameter with multiple batches
   - Test `batch_years` parameter with multiple years
   - Test `courses` parameter with multiple courses
   - Test `sections` parameter with multiple sections
   - Test `houses` parameter with multiple houses

3. **Exclusion Filtering**
   - Test `exclude_enrolled` parameter to exclude students already enrolled in an intervention

4. **Pagination**
   - Test page and limit parameters
   - Verify total count accuracy
   - Test edge cases (empty results, large datasets)

5. **Combined Filters**
   - Test multiple filters together
   - Test filter combinations that return no results
   - Test filter reset functionality

### 2. Filter Options API
**Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/students/filter-options`

#### Test Cases:
1. **Data Completeness**
   - Verify all active batches are returned
   - Verify all unique courses are returned
   - Verify all active sections with batch info are returned
   - Verify all active houses are returned
   - Verify unique years are returned

2. **Data Accuracy**
   - Verify batch-section relationships
   - Verify year sorting (descending)
   - Verify house color information

### 3. Batch Enrollment API
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/interventions/:id/enroll-batch`

#### Test Cases:
1. **Valid Batch Enrollment**
   - Enroll students from single batch
   - Enroll students from multiple batches
   - Apply section filters
   - Apply course filters

2. **Validation**
   - Test with empty batch_ids
   - Test with invalid intervention ID
   - Test capacity limits
   - Test duplicate enrollments

3. **Error Handling**
   - Test with non-existent batch IDs
   - Test with completed/archived interventions

### 4. Criteria-Based Enrollment API
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/interventions/:id/enroll-criteria`

#### Test Cases:
1. **Valid Criteria Enrollment**
   - Enroll by batch years
   - Enroll by courses
   - Enroll by sections
   - Enroll by houses
   - Combine multiple criteria

2. **Validation**
   - Test with no criteria provided
   - Test capacity limits
   - Test duplicate enrollments

## Phase 2: Frontend Component Testing

### 1. Enhanced StudentSelectionDialog

#### Test Cases:
1. **Tab Navigation**
   - Switch between Individual, Batch, and Criteria tabs
   - Verify tab state preservation
   - Test tab-specific functionality

2. **Individual Selection Tab**
   - Test advanced filter dropdowns
   - Test search functionality
   - Test pagination controls
   - Test student selection/deselection
   - Test "Select All Visible" functionality
   - Test capacity limits

3. **Batch Enrollment Tab**
   - Test batch selection checkboxes
   - Test section filtering
   - Test course filtering
   - Test enrollment preview
   - Test batch enrollment submission

4. **Criteria-Based Tab**
   - Test year selection
   - Test course selection
   - Test house selection
   - Test criteria combination
   - Test criteria enrollment submission

5. **Loading States**
   - Test loading indicators during API calls
   - Test error handling and display
   - Test success notifications

### 2. Integration with Intervention Management

#### Test Cases:
1. **Intervention Creation**
   - Test student selection during intervention creation
   - Verify selected students are properly saved
   - Test capacity validation

2. **Existing Intervention Management**
   - Test adding students to existing interventions
   - Test excluding already enrolled students
   - Test enrollment status updates

## Phase 3: End-to-End Testing

### 1. Complete Workflow Testing

#### Scenario 1: Individual Student Selection
1. Admin creates new intervention
2. Sets maximum capacity
3. Opens student selection dialog
4. Applies filters (batch, course, section)
5. Searches for specific students
6. Selects students individually
7. Saves selection
8. Verifies students are enrolled

#### Scenario 2: Batch Enrollment
1. Admin opens existing intervention
2. Navigates to student enrollment
3. Switches to Batch Enrollment tab
4. Selects multiple batches
5. Applies section/course filters
6. Reviews enrollment preview
7. Submits batch enrollment
8. Verifies all matching students are enrolled

#### Scenario 3: Criteria-Based Enrollment
1. Admin creates intervention for specific year
2. Opens student selection dialog
3. Switches to Criteria-Based tab
4. Selects target year (e.g., 2024)
5. Selects specific courses
6. Selects specific houses
7. Submits criteria enrollment
8. Verifies all matching students are enrolled

### 2. Performance Testing

#### Test Cases:
1. **Large Dataset Handling**
   - Test with 500+ students
   - Test pagination performance
   - Test filter response times

2. **Concurrent Operations**
   - Test multiple admins enrolling students simultaneously
   - Test enrollment conflicts and resolution

3. **Memory Usage**
   - Monitor memory usage during large operations
   - Test for memory leaks in long sessions

### 3. Error Handling Testing

#### Test Cases:
1. **Network Errors**
   - Test behavior with network disconnection
   - Test API timeout handling
   - Test retry mechanisms

2. **Data Validation Errors**
   - Test invalid filter combinations
   - Test capacity overflow scenarios
   - Test duplicate enrollment attempts

3. **User Experience**
   - Test error message clarity
   - Test recovery from error states
   - Test form state preservation
