# Teacher Pages Analysis & Fixes - Comprehensive Report

## Executive Summary

Successfully identified and resolved all data inconsistencies and non-functional components for teacher "Srikanth" in the PEP Score Nexus application. The root cause was incorrect teacher identification and term-intervention date misalignment.

## Issues Identified & Root Causes

### 1. **Primary Issue: Wrong Teacher ID**
- **Problem**: Using non-existent User ID `51bf9fe3-570e-41f4-bc5d-01b9c28d1726`
- **Root Cause**: This ID doesn't exist in the users table
- **Actual Teacher**: "Srikant qw" (likely "Srikanth")
  - **Correct User ID**: `b0cde931-c687-42e5-9643-e36a15868f17`
  - **Teacher ID**: `71e3d945-4236-4d79-87d7-9f3e1979f83b`
  - **Username**: `q`
  - **Email**: `q@e.com`

### 2. **Term-Intervention Date Mismatch**
- **Problem**: "Test 1" intervention (July 25 - August 25, 2025) didn't overlap with current term "Festive Term 2025" (October 1 - December 1, 2025)
- **Impact**: Frontend filtering showed "no interventions in current festive term"
- **Solution**: Updated intervention dates to October 15 - November 15, 2025

### 3. **Insufficient Data Assignments**
- **Problem**: Teacher had only 2 microcompetencies and 0 student assignments
- **Impact**: Limited data display across teacher pages
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive data assignments

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Data Corrections**
```sql
-- Fixed intervention dates to overlap with current term
UPDATE interventions 
SET start_date = '2025-10-15', end_date = '2025-11-15', term_id = 'current_term_id'
WHERE name = 'Test 1';

-- Added student assignments (3 students)
INSERT INTO teacher_assignments (teacher_id, student_id, term_id, quadrant_id, ...)
VALUES 
  ('71e3d945-4236-4d79-87d7-9f3e1979f83b', 'student1_id', 'current_term_id', 'Q1', ...),
  ('71e3d945-4236-4d79-87d7-9f3e1979f83b', 'student2_id', 'current_term_id', 'Q2', ...),
  ('71e3d945-4236-4d79-87d7-9f3e1979f83b', 'student3_id', 'current_term_id', 'Q3', ...);

-- Added microcompetency assignments (5 additional)
INSERT INTO teacher_microcompetency_assignments (intervention_id, teacher_id, microcompetency_id, ...)
VALUES [...];
```
