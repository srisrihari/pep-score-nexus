## 🔧 Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Student Login Credentials ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Original `student1` credentials not working
- **Solution**: Updated to use `test.student` / `password123`
- **Status**: Resolved

### 2. Batch UUID Mock Data ✅ FIXED (Previous Session)
- **Issue**: Batch completion using mock "batch-2" instead of real UUIDs
- **Solution**: Updated `smartBatchProgressionService.js` to use database UUIDs
- **Status**: Resolved and verified

### 3. CORS Configuration ✅ FIXED (Previous Session)
- **Issue**: Cross-origin requests blocked for testing dashboard
- **Solution**: Enhanced CORS configuration and testing server
- **Status**: Resolved

### 4. Missing Endpoints ⚠️ IDENTIFIED
- **Issue**: Some endpoints like `/api/v1/microcompetency-scores` not found
- **Analysis**: System uses different endpoint structure (`/teacher-microcompetencies/...`)
- **Status**: Not an issue - different API design pattern
