## üßÆ Enhanced Score Calculation

### Mathematical Accuracy
The system now uses **proper weighted averages** at all hierarchy levels:

1. **Microcompetency ‚Üí Component**: Weighted average using microcompetency weightages
2. **Component ‚Üí Sub-category**: Weighted average using component weightages
3. **Sub-category ‚Üí Quadrant**: Weighted average using sub-category weightages
4. **Quadrant ‚Üí HPS**: Weighted average using quadrant weightages

### Zero Weightage Handling
- Items with **0% weightage** are automatically excluded from calculations
- Parent scores calculated only from children with **non-zero weightages**
- If all children have 0% weightage, parent score is 0 (not undefined/null)

### Enhanced Unified Score Calculation Service V2
- **Version 2.0** calculation engine with proper mathematical accuracy
- **Dual Source Integration**: Traditional component scores + intervention microcompetency scores
- **No Double Counting**: Simple averages when combining traditional and intervention sources
- **Batch-Term Awareness**: Uses dynamic weightages for each batch-term combination

## üìä Validation System

### Multi-Level Validation
- **Real-time Validation**: Validates weightages as they're entered
- **Cross-level Validation**: Ensures hierarchy integrity
- **Business Rules**: Custom validation rules per level
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded indicators and progress bars

### Validation Rules
1. **Quadrant Level**: Must sum to 100%
2. **Sub-category Level**: Must sum to 100% within each quadrant
3. **Component Level**: Must sum to 100% within each sub-category
4. **Microcompetency Level**: Must sum to 100% within each component

### Error Handling
- **Detailed Error Messages**: Specific validation errors with suggestions
- **Bulk Validation**: Validate all levels simultaneously
- **Recovery Suggestions**: Automated suggestions for fixing validation issues

## üîÑ Workflow

   - Adjust minimum attendance requirements

3. **Configure Sub-Category Weightages**
   - Set weightages for sub-categories within each quadrant
   - Enable/disable specific sub-categories per batch-term

4. **Configure Component Weightages**
   - Set weightages for components within each sub-category
   - Enable/disable specific components per batch-term

5. **Configure Microcompetency Weightages**
