### 10. Security Architecture

#### 10.1 Authentication Flow

```mermaid

    participant User
    participant UI
    participant Auth
    participant API
    participant DB

    User->>UI: Enter Credentials
    UI->>Auth: Validate Input
    Auth->>API: Request Token
    API->>DB: Verify Credentials
    DB-->>API: User Data
    API-->>Auth: JWT Token
    Auth-->>UI: Update State
    UI-->>User: Redirect to Dashboard
```

#### 10.2 Access Control Matrix

| Role | Student Data | Teacher Data | Admin Data | System Settings |
|------|-------------|--------------|------------|-----------------|
| Student | R | - | - | - |
| Teacher | R/W | R/W | - | - |
| Admin | R/W | R/W | R/W | R/W |
