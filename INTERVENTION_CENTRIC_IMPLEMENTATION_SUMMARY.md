# PEP Score Nexus - Intervention-Centric Implementation Summary

## 🎯 **Overview**

Successfully transformed PEP Score Nexus from a direct quadrant/component scoring system to a comprehensive **intervention-centric** educational management platform. The system now properly reflects the business requirement where all scoring flows through interventions and microcompetencies.

## ✅ **Completed Implementation**

### **Phase 1: Database Schema Migration** 🗄️

**✅ New Tables Created:**
- `microcompetencies` - Individual microcompetencies within each component
- `intervention_microcompetencies` - Links interventions to specific microcompetencies with weightages
- `teacher_microcompetency_assignments` - Assigns teachers to specific microcompetencies within interventions
- `microcompetency_scores` - Primary scoring table (replaces direct component scoring)

**✅ Updated Existing Tables:**
- `interventions` - Added term_id, scoring_deadline, total_weightage, is_scoring_open
- `tasks` - Added microcompetency_id (to link tasks to microcompetencies)
- `intervention_enrollments` - Added enrollment_deadline

**✅ Calculated Views:**
- `student_competency_scores` - Aggregates microcompetency scores to competency level
- `student_quadrant_scores` - Aggregates competency scores to quadrant level  
- `student_intervention_scores` - Calculates total intervention scores

## 🔄 **Correct Intervention-Centric Workflow**

### **1. Admin Workflow:**
1. **Create Intervention** → Set basic details and term
2. **Add Microcompetencies** → Select microcompetencies with weightages (total = 100%)
3. **Assign Teachers** → Assign teachers to specific microcompetencies with permissions
4. **Assign Students** → Enroll student batches in the intervention
5. **Set Deadlines** → Configure scoring deadlines and open/close scoring
6. **Monitor Progress** → Track scoring completion and generate reports

### **2. Teacher Workflow:**
1. **View Assigned Interventions** → See interventions with assigned microcompetencies
2. **Create Tasks** → Create tasks for assigned microcompetencies
3. **Conduct Tasks** → Execute intervention activities
4. **Score Students** → Score students on assigned microcompetencies within deadlines
5. **Provide Feedback** → Add detailed feedback for each microcompetency score

### **3. Student Workflow:**
1. **View Assigned Interventions** → See enrolled interventions and progress
2. **Complete Tasks** → Participate in intervention activities
3. **View Scores** → See intervention completion and scores
4. **Hierarchical Breakdown** → View scores at microcompetency → competency → quadrant levels
5. **Track Progress** → Monitor overall performance across interventions

### **4. Score Flow:**
```
Microcompetency Scores (Teacher Input)
           ↓
    Competency Scores (Weighted Aggregation)
           ↓
     Quadrant Scores (Component Aggregation)
           ↓
   Overall Intervention Score (Quadrant Weightages)
```
